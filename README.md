Some Solidity CTF solutions, and a mini-project written in Vyper. From an old blockchain development class. To prove basic proficiency in solidity and blockchain coding. Imported from GitLab.

The actual CTF solutions are in the "sictf" and "solidity" folders. Chess project is in the "final" folder.

(The vyper chess program probably doesn't compile anymore since vyper was still in development, and even changed versions in the middle of our project time, which broke most of our projects' code and really messed with all of us.)
